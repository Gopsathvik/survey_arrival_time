# Contributing
In this project, we will be adopting the Git version control workflow. Individual collaborator will have their own repository forked from the main master repository. Users can work locally by cloning their own repository and merging from the upstream master. To upload their work, changes can be pushed to their local and then merged into the master via pull requests.

### Example of a contributing workflow:

**Clone the repository **

```git clone <repo folder>```

**Create a branch of repository **

Navigate to the <repo folder> in your terminal
  
```git branch <branch name>```

**To submit changes to master branch**

`git add .`<br>
`git commit -m <meaningful message>`<br>
`git push -u origin <name of your branch>`<br>
`submit pull request to main repo`
